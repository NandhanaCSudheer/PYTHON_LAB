The correct description of system software is that it is used to control the operations of a computer.
It includes the operating system, device drivers, utilities, and other software that manages hardware and allows other software to run effectively.
It doesn't directly focus on running applications 
(that's more of an application software role)
or specifically debugging 
(which is usually done by debugging tools, though the system software can assist in that process).Thank You
